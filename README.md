This task was implemented using core Java file handling tools and a standard development platform to demonstrate how files can be created, read, and modified through a console-based utility. The primary tool used in this task is the Java programming language, which provides built-in support for file input and output operations. Java was selected because it is platform-independent, reliable, and widely used in both academic and industry environments. The program follows a menu-driven approach, making it easy for users to interact with the file system by choosing different operations such as writing, reading, and modifying file content.

The main set of tools used in this task comes from the java.io package, which is essential for file handling in Java. The FileWriter class is used to write data into a file, allowing the program to create a new file or overwrite existing content. The BufferedWriter class is used to modify the file by appending new data, which improves performance and ensures efficient writing operations. For reading data, the FileReader and BufferedReader classes are used together to read the file line by line in a smooth and memory-efficient manner. These tools demonstrate how Java handles persistent data storage using text files, which is a fundamental concept in programming.

To make the program interactive and user-friendly, the Scanner class from the java.util package was used. This allows users to provide input at runtime, such as selecting menu options and entering text to write or append to the file. Runtime input makes the application flexible and realistic, as it simulates how actual software systems accept and process user commands. The use of a loop and switch-case structure further enhances usability by allowing repeated operations until the user chooses to exit.

The task also includes proper exception handling using try-catch blocks to manage input-output errors. This ensures that the program does not crash unexpectedly when file-related issues occur, such as missing files or access problems. Error handling is an important aspect of professional software development, and its inclusion demonstrates good coding practices. Clear success and error messages are displayed to guide the user and improve the overall experience.

The entire application was developed and executed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the programming platform. VS Code is widely used because it is lightweight, fast, and supports Java development through the Java Extension Pack. This platform provides features such as syntax highlighting, error detection, debugging support, and an integrated terminal for compiling and running Java programs. VS Code makes it easy for students and beginners to manage Java projects efficiently without complex setup.

This file handling utility is applicable in academic projects, Java lab exercises, internships such as CODTECH, and beginner-level software development tasks. It demonstrates essential programming concepts such as file creation, reading, modification, exception handling, and menu-driven program design. In real-world applications, similar file handling techniques are used in logging systems, report generation, configuration file management, and data storage utilities. Overall, this task effectively showcases how Java’s built-in tools and VS Code as a development platform can be used to build a simple yet practical file handling application.
